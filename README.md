This program allows a user to play themself in a two player game of Yahtzee

## Description

I programmed this for the finals of my progamming methods course. We were allowed to do planning and workflow before the day of the finals. On the day of the finals, we were given 7 hours to complete a 30 minute written portion and the rest of the time was spent coding and providing unit tests for our program. I'm putting this here to look back on it.
